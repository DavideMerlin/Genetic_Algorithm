# Genetic_Algorithm
This project uses the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset to build a classifier. This, will train on the dataset and it will be able to classify if the energy is Gamma Radiation or Hadron Radiation. This project was possible thanks to the help of a genetic programming library called tpot. The model can be use to make estimations about countries (e.g has the temperature in country x risen over the past 10 years?)
