# Genetic_Algorithm
This project uses the [MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope) to build a classifier. This, will train on the dataset and it will be able to classify if the energy is Gamma Radiation or Hadron Radiation. This project was possible thanks to the help of a genetic programming library called [tpot](https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/). The model can be use to make estimations about countries (e.g has the temperature in country x risen over the past 10 years?)
